      "We meet many people every day, but only some leave marks. Kanya is one such person. She is one of the most dedicated professionals Iâ€™ve worked with and is willing to extend help whenever you need it. She was my R&D associate and was very organized in providing inputs for documentation. She has been applauded by her seniors multiple times for her excellent skills at presenting the feature after development. Kanya stands out for her proactiveness, positive attitude, commitment, and initiative. Her contribution is valuable and I highly recommend Kanya and would love to work with her again.",

      "It's very rarely in your life that you come across a person like Kanya who not only is technically sound and proficient but also has the goodwill to go out of her way to lend a helping hand to others. She is humble, hard-working, polite, talented, calm, composed and especially a very delightful person to work with. She has an elegant way of writing and organizing her code. She is also very good at team and time management. She's always ready to take up responsibilities and very well ensure that all the 'i's are dotted and the 't's crossed while fulfilling it on-time. I had the opportunity to work with her and would love to work with her again on any given day. I believe every team needs a 'Dependable and Reliable' team player like her.",
